- maximum radius needed
    - for each index
        - if max done
        - else find smallest convex hull from all radius
            - find maximum radius and center of new convex hull
                - find 3 set of points
                - find new center from a triangle
                - set the new center from there
- work this out
    - get a set if distances
    - get a set of coordinates (last touching position)
        - find shortest set in each quadrant
        - if we have 4 quadrants (relative to itself)
            - delete 1 quadrant with longest distance
        - take the remaining quadrants and figure out the new space
            - 0: not possible
            - 1: that means you're at the center
            - 2: find the midpoint between 2 points.  radius is half
            - 3: find the convex hull.  Radius is the smallest touching
- another method:
    - loop through all index
        - figure out initial flee slope
        - head towards that slop until circle edge
            - record distance
            - record x, y
        - find longest distance.  Take new x, y coordinates
        - testing blah
